1. Load the `housing_prices.csv` data set and undertake an initial exploration of the data. You will find details on the data set on the relevant [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices)

<br>

```{r}
housing_prices <- read_csv("data/housing_prices.csv")

glimpse(housing_prices)
```

<br>

2. We expect the `total_rooms` of houses to be strongly correlated with `total_bedrooms`. Use `ggpairs()` to investigate correlations between these two variables.

<br> 

```{r}
ggpairs(housing_prices, columns = c("total_rooms", "total_bedrooms"))
```
There appears to be a strong correlation between the two variables.

<br>

3. So, we do find significant correlations. Let's drop `total_bedrooms` from the dataset, and use only `total_rooms` going forward.

<br>

```{r}
housing_prices <- housing_prices %>% 
  select(-total_bedrooms)
```

<br>

4. We are interested in developing a regression model for the `median_house_value` of a house in terms of the possible predictor variables in the dataset. 

  i. Use `ggpairs()` to investigate correlations between `median_house_value` and the predictors (this may take a while to run, don't worry, make coffee or something).

<br>

```{r}
ggpairs(housing_prices)
```

<br>

  ii. Perform further `ggplot` visualisations of any significant correlations you find.

<br>

5. Shortly we may try a regression model to fit the categorical predictor `ocean_proximity`. Investigate the level of `ocean_proximity` predictors. How many dummy variables do you expect to get from it?
    
<br>
 
6. Start with simple linear regression. Regress `median_house_value` on `median_income` and check the regression diagnostics.

<br> 

7. Add another predictor of your choice. Check your assumptions, diagnostics, and interpret the model.

# Extension
    
<br>

8. Try adding an interaction between `log(medium_income)` and your chosen categorical predictor. Do you think this interaction term is statistically justified?

<br>

9. Find and plot an appropriate visualisation to show the effect of this interaction
