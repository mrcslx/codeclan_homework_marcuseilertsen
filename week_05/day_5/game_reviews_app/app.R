  # The following is a bar chart that shows the 10 lowest rated games (by professional critics) for a platform chosen by the user. I have limited it to a bottom 10 in order to keep it legible, however there is also a table view in the second tab should the user want more information. I have set up the dashboard to show one platform at a time, however the user can also select one or several game genres as well as a range of release years. The aim is to highlight the worst games in the dataset so that the user can avoid them or maybe intentionally seek them out if they are so inclined.
